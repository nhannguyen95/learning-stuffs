- [Dashes vs. Underscores in URLs](https://writing.fletom.com/dashes_vs_underscores_in_URLs?fbclid=IwAR0k6BS-FbbaRpCKIX-khb9qZdWzxxVN7VvshRiIwOAXe9fKIOy6l0rhuc4)
  > Use underscores, because dashes in English have their own meaning. `man-eating-shark` is a man-eating shark or a man eating shark meat?

- [What is REST](https://restfulapi.net/)
  > Decouple client and server, cacheable, stateless.
    Resources = any information that can be named.
    Resource representation = state of resource at a timestamp, data format of resource representation = media-type.

- [Why HATEOAS is useless and what that means for REST](https://medium.com/@andreasreiser94/why-hateoas-is-useless-and-what-that-means-for-rest-a65194471bc8?fbclid=IwAR0StTDqWbaZvltEUgx0ynLM6B0X_03PlCGhZGwX8rYe3u_xyp57nNlUYRs)
  > HATEOAS:
  >  - from root URI, user can navigate entire interface dynamically (info goes with controls).
  >  - evolvability by creating a uniform interface.
  >
  > Problems:
  >  - clients won't navigate the API dynamically => need API specification.
  >  - API is versioned by numberring (`/v1/`) => loss evolvability

  > UUIDs: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000
  >   - rely either on timestamp or randomness
  > ULIDs: 01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
  >   - use both timestamp and randomness
  >   - prettier than UUIDs
  >   - lexicographically sortable
